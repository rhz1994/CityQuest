CityQuest is an interactive adventure app that takes users on a journey through historical cities, solving mysteries and challenges related to landmarks, history, and culture. The app guides the user through quests, providing clues and puzzles at physical locations.
Features
1. Start Screen

    Upon opening the app, the user sees a map showing the nearest city based on their location.

    The user selects a city, and they are taken to a new page where the first challenge of the quest appears.

2. Challenge Cards

    For each city, a series of cards represent the challenges the user will face.

    Each card displays information about the challenge (e.g., "Find a letter at a public landmark") and a button to start the task.

    After completing a challenge, the user can press a button to unlock the next challenge.

3. Interactive Map & Physical Locations

    The user is provided with a physical location (e.g., a monument, park, or building) to visit.

    Once the user reaches the location, a new clue or question related to the puzzle appears in the app.

4. Puzzles & Quizzes

    After visiting a physical location, the user must solve a puzzle or answer a question related to the city's history.

    If the user answers correctly, the next challenge is unlocked.

5. Mystery Connection

    All challenges and puzzles are connected to a larger mystery that involves the city's history (e.g., an ancient legend or historical event).

    Completing each quest brings the user closer to solving the mystery.

    After completing a challenge, the user receives feedback:

        Time taken to solve the challenge.
